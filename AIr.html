				<h2>Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard</h2>
				<p class="first">Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure used to report the air quality in a particular
					area.
					It is
					calculated based on the levels of air pollutants such as ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide,
					sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. AQI ranges from 0-500, with a higher number
					indicating worse air quality. People can use AQI to plan their outdoor activities and take
					appropriate
					measures to protect themselves from harmful pollutants. Some common effects of poor air quality on
					health include respiratory problems, heart diseases, and even cancer. Governments and local
					authorities
					often monitor AQI to implement policies and regulations to reduce air pollution and improve public
					health.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="b">
				<h2>Air Pollution Map</h2>
				<p class="first">An Air Pollution Map is a visual representation of air quality data in a given
					geographical
					area. These
					maps are generated by measuring the concentration of air pollutants at various locations and using
					that
					information to create a visualization of the air quality. Air Pollution Maps can be used by
					individuals,
					businesses, and governments to understand the level of pollution in different areas and make
					informed
					decisions about their activities. For example, people with respiratory issues can use the map to
					avoid
					areas with poor air quality, while businesses can use the map to identify locations for new
					facilities
					that have cleaner air. Governments can also use the maps to create policies and regulations to
					address
					air pollution and protect public health.</p>

				<p class="second">1.Limit sugary drinks
					Sugary drinks like sodas, fruit juices, and sweetened teas are the primary source of added sugar in
					the
					American diet.

					Unfortunately, findings from several studies point to sugar-sweetened beverages increasing risk of
					heart
					disease and type 2 diabetes, even in people who are not carrying excess body fat.

					Sugar-sweetened beverages are also uniquely harmful for children, as they can contribute not only to
					obesity in children but also to conditions that usually do not develop until adulthood, like type 2
					diabetes, high blood pressure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
				</p>
				<p class="second">2.Eat nuts and seeds
					Some people avoid nuts because they are high in fat. However, nuts and seeds are incredibly
					nutritious.
					They are packed with protein, fiber, and a variety of vitamins and minerals.

					Nuts may help you lose weight and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

					Additionally, one large observational study noted that a low intake of nuts and seeds was
					potentially
					linked to an increased risk of death from heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes.
				</p>
				<p class="second">3.Eat fatty fish
					Fish is a great source of high-quality protein and healthy fat. This is particularly true of fatty
					fish,
					such as salmon, which is loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids and various other
					nutrients.

					Studies show that people who eat fish regularly have a lower risk for several conditions, including
					heart disease, dementia, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

				<p class="third">
					1. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that air pollution is responsible for seven million
					deaths
					worldwide each year. This staggering figure highlights the urgent need for action to reduce air
					pollution levels globally.
				</p>
				<p class="third">
					2. In India, air pollution has become a major public health crisis, with toxic levels of particulate
					matter
					causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems. The Indian government has introduced
					measures
					to reduce air pollution, such as a ban on diesel vehicles, but much more needs to be done to address
					the
					problem.
				</p>
				<p class="third">
					3. China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has taken significant steps to reduce its
					air
					pollution levels in recent years. The country has shut down coal-fired power plants and introduced
					new
					regulations to limit emissions from factories and vehicles.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="news2">
				<p class="third">
					4. In the United States, air pollution is a major concern in cities such as Los Angeles, where smog
					levels
					can be dangerously high. The state of California has introduced ambitious targets to reduce
					greenhouse
					gas emissions, but progress has been slow due to political opposition.
				</p>
				<p class="third">
					5. The impact of air pollution on children is particularly concerning, with studies showing that
					exposure
					to polluted air can lead to cognitive and developmental delays. Parents and educators are calling
					for
					more action to protect children from the harmful effects of air pollution.
				</p>
				<p class="third">
					6. In Europe, air pollution has become a leading environmental cause of death, responsible for
					around
					400,000 premature deaths each year. The European Union has set ambitious targets to reduce
					emissions,
					including a goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
